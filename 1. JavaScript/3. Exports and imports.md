If you have created a js file and you have declared a variable or a function in the js file, and you want to use the 
function or variable in a different file, then you must first export the function/variable from the initial js file using
the **export** keyword. You may also use the **default** word to ensure that whatever filename you are importing from the js file is the default one


For example,

### person.js:
```
const person = {
    name: 'Max'
}

export default person
```

### app.js
```
import person from './person.js'
import prs from './person.js'
```

Both prs and person will return the constant function 'person'

On the other hand, for es6, you would use **named imports**:

### utility.js
```
export const clean = () => {...}
export const baseData = 10;
```

### app.js
import {baseData} from './utility.js'
import {clean as cl} from './utility.js'
// import * as bundled from './utility.js'
