Classes are blueprints for objects

Class has properties and methods

Properties are like "variables attached to classes/objects"
Methods are like "functions attached to classes/objects"

class Person {
    name = 'Max'        //Property
    call = () => {...}  //Method
}

Instantiating a class:

const myPerson = new Person()
myPerson.call()
console.log(myPerson.name)

Classes also support inheritence.

class Person extends Master
